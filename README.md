<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview



This project was fun to build, I tried to keep my code as minimal as possible and easy to read for anyone who wants to have a look to gain insight 0f some sort. I really enjoyed the experience, I learnt to use the 'writing-mode' property in CSS to structure the vertical text next to the pictures, my first time using that. I used CSS Grid in structuring my layout making it as responsive as possible without so much altering with media queries.

You can checkout the [demo](https://my-team-page1.netlify.app/).
